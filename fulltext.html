    <div id="fulltext">
      <span id="l1">
      There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some
      punctuations that are not. Let us begin with the punctuations that are not
      </span>
    <span id="l2">
      Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most
      uninteresting is the question mark
      </span>
    <span id="l3">
      The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a
      brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with
      writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting
      </span>
    <span id="l4">
      It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody
      who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written
      in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the
      question mark
      </span>
    <span id="l5">
      Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases
      neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an
      unnecessary name of something
      </span>
    <span id="l6">
      A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question<br>
      and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the<br>
      question is already there in the writing
    </span>
    <span id="l7">
      Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always<br>
      found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it
    </span>
    <span id="l8">
      Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, they
      are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the
      printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a question is
      a question what is the use of its being a question
    </span>
    <span id="l9">
      The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing I found
      it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and
      exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way
    </span>
    <span id="l10">
      Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate
      anybody can and does see it that way
    </span>
    <span id="l11">
      So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a
      way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther
      into that
    </span>
    <span id="l12">
      There are besides dashes and dots, and these might be interesting spaces
      might be interesting. They might if one felt that way about them
    </span>
    <span id="l13">
      One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is
      the apostrophe for possession
    </span>
    <span id="l14">
      Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many
      that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender
      insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do
      without it
    </span>
    <span id="l15">
      One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that
      from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put
      it in to make the possessive case
    </span>
    <span id="l16">
      I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, there it
      is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well
      perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness
    </span>
    <span id="l17">
      At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone
      if it has come in and sometimes it has come in
    </span>
    <span id="l18">
      I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in
    </span>
    <span id="l19">
      So now to come to the real question of punctuation, periods, commas,
      colons, semi-colons and capitals and small letters<br />
      I have had a long and complicated life with all these
    </span>
    <span id="l20">
      Let us begin with these I use the least first and these are colons and
      semi-colons, one might add to these commas<br />

      When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still do
      feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely
      possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing
      should go on what had colons and commas to do with it, what had periods to
      do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with
      writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in
      connection with writing. What had colons and semi-colons to do with it
      what had commas to do with it what had periods to do with it
    </span>
    <span id="l21">
      What had periods to do with it. Inevitably no matter how completely I had
      to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again stop sometime
      and if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again
      and again stop some time then periods had to exist. Beside I had always
      like the look of periods and I liked what they did. Stopping sometime did
      not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was
      only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural
      happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. I really never
      stopped using them
    </span>
    <span id="l22">
      Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to
      commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways, that has happened lately
      with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later I will read
      you a little of it. By the time I had written this poem about three years
      ago periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own
    </span>
    <span id="l23">
      They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s
      writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them but
      one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so
      they could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist in
      this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own. They
      did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons and semi-colons
      do. Yes you do feel what I mean
    </span>
    <span id="l24">
      Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of
      their own a time of their own. And that feeling that life that necessity
      that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is the reason
      that I have always remained true to periods so much so that as I say
      recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever
      needed them
    </span>
    <span id="l25">
      You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a
      colon or a semi-colon
    </span>
    <span id="2l6">
      There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you
      can think of them as commas and as such they are purely servile or you can
      think of them as periods and then using them can make you feel adventurous
      I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never
      have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile
      they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience
      and they are put there just for practical purposes. Semi-colons and colons
      had for me from the first completely this character the character that a
      comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and
      definitely I have never used them. But now dimly and definitely I do see
      that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the
      character of the period and so it might have been an adventure to use
      them. I really do not think so
    </span>
    <span id="l27">
      I think however lively they are or disguised they are they are definitely
      more comma than period and so really I cannot regret not having used them.
      They are more powerful more imposing more pretentious than a comma but
      they are a comma all the same. They really have within them deeply within
      them fundamentally within them the comma nature. And now what does a comma
      do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them
    </span>
    <span id="l28">What does a comma do</span>
    <span id="l29">
      I have refused them so often and left the out so much and did without them
      so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent to them
    </span>
    <span id="l30">
      I do not now care whether you put them in or not but for a long time I
      felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do with them.
    </span>
    <span id="l31">
      As I say commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their
      use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one’s own interest and I do
      decidedly like to like my own interest my own interest in what I am doing.
      A comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your
      shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it
      and to me for many years and I still do feel that way about it only now I
      do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively
      degrading. Let me tell you what I feel and what I mean and what I felt and
      what I meant.
    </span>
    <span id="l32">
      When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs
      active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a
      passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided
      by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of
      the active life of writing
    </span>
    <span id="l33">
      Complications make eventually for simplicity and therefore I have always
      liked dependent adverbial clauses. I have like dependent adverbial clauses
      because of their variety of dependence and independence. You can see how
      loving the intensity of complication of these things that commas would be
      degrading. Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final
      simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to
      bring about that simplicity
    </span>
    <span id="l34">
      Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel
      about the comma as I did and as I do
    </span>
    <span id="l35">
      Think about anything you really like to do and you will see what I mean
    </span>
    <span id="l36">
      When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut
      the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so
      anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing
      any sentence or reading it after it has been written. And what does a
      comma do, a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it
      enough is easy enough without the comma. A long complicated sentence
      should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the
      comma, well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and
      take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself
      that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has
      something to do with going on, but taking a breath well you are always
      taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath
    </span>
    <span id="l37">
      Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it very very
      strongly. And so I almost never used a comma. The longer, the more
      complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words
      I had following one after another, the more the very more I had of them
      the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by
      themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in
      a comma
    </span>
<span id="l38">
      So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a
      little different but more so and later I will go into that. But that is
    the way I felt about punctuation in prose
